/**
 * All geometry objects within the cladosG package have elements that form a
 * basis to span the vector space related to the algebra. This basis is
 * represented in the algebra as various products of the generators. This class
 * representation uses sets of generators as Blades and a list of Blades. It
 * also maintains a few methods that help manipulate them.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * The gradeCount is tracked using byte integers as it isn't expected that
 * anyone will work with algebras of more than 126 generators any time soon.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * The bladeCount is computed as (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; gradeCount - 1) instead of stored.
 * It is reported as an integer though that DOES limit the size of a basis to 31
 * generators. Again, it isn't expected anyone will need more any time soon.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * The bladeList is stored as an ArrayList of Blades that should be no longer
 * than bladeCount. There is nothing to stop it from being longer or shorter,
 * though, so this is a potential source of error. It really SHOULD be
 * immutable once constructed correctly. Same goes for the Blades contained in
 * the ArrayList.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * Blade keys are now stored inside the Blades. There is no separate array for
 * them in the Basis. The primary use for keys is sorting the Blades and
 * detecting which blade is found at the head of the list for each grade. This
 * is useful when multiplying multivectors that are sparsely populated in terms
 * of their coefficients. The multiplication algorithm can skip over grades not
 * present in the multivector and skip potentially large blocks in the sums with
 * vanishing contributions. However, sparseness is detected using a
 * multivector's key and NOT a Blade's key. Once Blades are sorted into a basis,
 * blade keys are only used to name them in maps.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * NOTE that Blade keys are currently kept as long integers. The key for a
 * pscalar in a 14 generator basis is 2234152501943160L. For 15 generator
 * algebras the key is 81985529216486896L. Long integers can't hold keys much
 * larger than that. At some point keys will shift to Java's BigInteger class
 * and impose another performance penalty. Not yet, though. Best practice would
 * be to avoid computations demanding heavy use of blade keys.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * The data in this class is stored in objects instead of arrays of primitives.
 * This is intentional. Doing so allows a system to lay them out in memory in
 * any way it finds convenient. There IS an overhead associated with this plan,
 * but it is in recognition that virtualization puts distance between an
 * application and the hardware on which it runs.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * It is expected that Basis objects will be cached, though. There is no reason
 * to create copies within running applications. One MAY do so as no singleton
 * enforcement occurs, but every basis of the same number of generators passes
 * the equality test. A convenient cache already exists in the singleton
 * GCache.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * The choice a limit of 15 generators produces a maximum basis size of 32,768.
 * More can be used, but one must change the 'magic numbers' in the
 * CladosConstant class and recompile.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * There IS a sort buried in the constructor for a Basis. After Blades are
 * generated using the private powerSet method, they are sorted on the 'natural
 * order'. Blades implement Comparable and use their keys for compareTo(). THAT
 * is why blade keys are now buried in Blade objects. Doing so enables one line
 * of code here to use Java's Collections class to decide what sorting algorithm
 * to use. That means this class no longer implements its own sort algorithm. It
 * is likely the developer community is much better at writing sort algorithms,
 * so this is recognition of that reality.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * This class probably should be implemented as a Java enumeration. It might be
 * some day. The problem with that is construction time scales as O(N^2).
 * Pre-construction of small basis objects makes good sense, but larger ones
 * become problematic especially for users who never intend to use them. If
 * one's primary interest involves Euclidian 3-space, what need is there of a
 * basis with 14 geometric directions and 16384 linear dimensions that takes a
 * sizeable fraction of a minute to construct? So it is suggested that Best
 * Practice among those who build physical models is to prebuild what you need
 * and load it all to the cache. Use GBuilder to do it for you. 
 * That said, it is obvious why the copy constructor was removed.
