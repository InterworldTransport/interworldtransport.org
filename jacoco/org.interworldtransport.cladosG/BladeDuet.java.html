/**
 * This class serves two highly related purposes.&lt;br&gt;
 * 1) It supports blade discovery in blade multiplication by acting as a bucket for their generators that can
 * be reduced using a signature.&lt;br&gt;
 * 2) It supports blade discovery in blade complement operations and compute the resulting blade's sign so it
 * correctly multiplies to the pscalar in the basis that contains the input blade.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * In Clados v1 the multiplication methods were all buried in the Basis and GProduct classes. BaldeDuet surfaces
 * them in order to support parallelization of product table generation. As a side benefit, the complement 
 * operation supportual Dual() in Clados v2 also benefits from parallelization.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * NOTE: BladeDuet makes use of streams, but intentionally avoids internal parallelization of computations. Most of 
 * what must be done must be in sequence. It is a calling objects that may parallelize operations relying on BladeDuet.
