		task complete in 4 iterations. (Ceiling of log_2() of exponent )
		but did overflows happen?

		The longest long integer (32bits) is 	9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (or 2^63 - 1)
		The pscalar in a 15 generator algebra is   81,985,529,216,486,896 (grade count = 16)
		while 16^15 (15 bit binary key) is		1,152,921,504,606,846,976 (meaning result doesn't overflow)
		but setting sq = 16^16 does overflow. Fortunately sq isn't need again in this maximum case.
			This overflow is why java's Math.pow() using double precision floats, but it does so at a small cost.
			It isn't clear that Clados should roll it's own pow function, but it isn't used often by Blade 
			or Basis and developers are discouraged from re-using it. Even large byte entries can blow up.
		Speed tests suggest any change in efficiency is negligible for our purposes.
