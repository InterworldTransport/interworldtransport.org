/**
 * A CladosG Monad is better known as a multivector to anyone with experience
 * with geometric algebras. Think of them as vectors, but with higher ranked
 * elements also represented. There is more to it than that, but that is the
 * nutshell version.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * Caution | To the software community, 'vector' is generally understood to be a
 * dynamic array data structure. To a physicist, it is a thing that belongs to a
 * vector space and follows extra rules regarding allowed transformations. It's
 * 'thing' nature is much more important than how it acts as a data structure.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * The 'allowed' transformations are operations that do not change the 'thing'
 * nature of the object represented. For example, a meter stick is what it is no
 * matter how a coordinate system used to represent it is rotated. A
 * representation of the meter stick would have to be identifiable as the same
 * thing after a rotation, meaning many apparently different sets of data in the
 * structure are actually the same thing.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * A 'multivector' can represent 'things' that are of higher geometric rank than
 * lines. A monad has a data structure inside to support both coordinates and
 * reference information. 'Allowed' transformations on the reference frame
 * should cause the coefficients to shift the correct way leaving the monad as
 * it was from an external perspective. That's HOW a monad represents a thing.
 * It is expected to be invariant under 'allowed' transformations of the
 * contained data.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * Why 'monad' instead of 'multivector'? Try typing it yourself a few thousand
 * times and you'll understand. The name doesn't actually matter, but it is from
 * an old tradition when physicists wrote linear transformations as dyads. Two
 * vectors were written side by side, but no simplifying action could be taken.
 * The dyad was described as an operator, so the vectors were applied to another
 * operand rather than each other. Few textbooks do that anymore (we have matrix
 * algebra now) and the name has fallen into dis-use. It is revived here because
 * we need something short and useful. A 'dyad' will be two monads in a list
 * which is generalized in another CladosG class called nyad.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * Doesn't 'monad' conflict with mathemetician's usage in Category Theory and
 * with Functional Programming advocates bringing that mathematics to the real
 * world? Yes. What the functional programmers are doing is terribly important,
 * so don't confuse their monad with what a physicist needs. This shouldn't be
 * too hard. Y'all have been doing it for 'vector' for a few decades. You'd
 * rather something else? 'Unad'? Make your case by helping out.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * NOTE | Regarding suppressed unchecked type casting warnings, they are
 * restricted to the casting that happens in FBuilder and
 * CladosFListBuilder classes mostly. This happens when we copy number objects
 * to avoid mutability using a generic copyOf() method. As long as the
 * coefficients in a monad are valid ProtoN children implementing Field
 * and Normalizable, the copyOf() functions will work fine. There are two cases
 * where things can go awry, though.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * 1. It is probably possible for someone to mix ProtoN children in a
 * Scale object containing a mondad's coefficients. The copyOf() functions will
 * faithfully copy them as they are. The scale() methods and others will
 * faithfully pass them to a Scale object to be used as appropriate there. For
 * example, Scale's scale() method will try to use them as given. What
 * happens, though, is the inbound number gets multiplied against others AS THEY
 * UNDERSTAND MULTIPLICATION. Scaling a complex by a real will work all right
 * unless one thought the scaling was between two complex numbers. THAT'S why
 * Scale AND Monad implement Modal, but nothing is enforced yet.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * 2. If someone invents a new ProtoN child, there is a ton of work to do
 * as the builders and other enumerations have to be adapted. Any class
 * implementing Modal might have methods that switch on CladosField values.
 * So... be cautious about inventing new CladosF numbers. Lots of work will have
 * to be done.

	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * 1. If the monad is an actual idempotent, return true. This is trivial case.
	 * 2. If not, find first non-zero coefficient of the square of the monad and...

	 * This would normally cause warnings by the compiler since the generic named in
	 * the internal map IS a ProtoN child AND casting an unchecked type could

	 * &lt;br&gt;
