/**
 * A CladosG Monad is better known as a multivector to anyone with experience with geometric algebras. 
 * Think of them as vectors, but with higher ranked elements also represented. There is more to it than that, 
 * but that is the nutshell version.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * Caution | To the software community, 'vector' is generally understood to be a dynamic array data structure. 
 * To a physicist, it is a thing that belongs to a vector space and follows extra rules regarding allowed 
 * transformations. It's 'thing' nature is much more important than how it acts as a data structure.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * The 'allowed' transformations are operations that do not change the 'thing' nature of the object represented. 
 * For example, a meter stick is what it is no matter how a coordinate system used to represent it is rotated. A
 * representation of the meter stick would have to be identifiable as the same thing after a rotation, meaning 
 * many apparently different sets of data in the structure are actually the same thing.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * A 'multivector' can represent 'things' that are of higher geometric rank than lines. A monad has a data 
 * structure inside to support both coordinates and reference information. 'Allowed' transformations on the 
 * reference frame should cause the coefficients to shift the correct way leaving the monad as it was from an 
 * external perspective. That's HOW a monad represents a thing. It is expected to be invariant under 'allowed' 
 * transformations of the contained data.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * Why 'monad' instead of 'multivector'? Try typing it yourself a few thousand times and you'll understand. The name 
 * doesn't actually matter, but it is from an old tradition when physicists wrote linear transformations as dyads. 
 * Two vectors were written side by side, but no simplifying action could be taken. The dyad was described as an 
 * operator, so the vectors were applied to another operand rather than each other. Few textbooks do that anymore 
 * (we have matrix algebra now) and the name has fallen into dis-use. It is revived here because we need something 
 * short and useful. A 'dyad' will be two monads in a list which is generalized in another CladosG class called nyad.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * Doesn't 'monad' conflict with mathemetician's usage in Category Theory and with Functional Programming advocates
 * bringing that mathematics to the real world? Yes. What the functional programmers are doing is terribly important,
 * so don't confuse their monad with what a physicist needs. This shouldn't be too hard. Y'all have been doing it 
 * for 'vector' for a few decades. You'd rather something else? 'Unad'? Make your case by helping out.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * NOTE | Regarding suppressed unchecked type casting warnings, they are restricted to the casting that happens in 
 * FBuilder and CladosFListBuilder classes mostly. This happens when we copy number objects to avoid mutability 
 * using a generic copyOf() method. As long as the coefficients in a monad are valid ProtoN children implementing 
 * Field and Normalizable, the copyOf() functions will work fine. There are two cases where things can go awry.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * 1. It is probably possible for someone to mix ProtoN children in a Scale object containing a mondad's 
 * coefficients. The copyOf() functions will faithfully copy them as they are. The scale() methods and others will 
 * faithfully pass them to a Scale object to be used as appropriate there. For example, Scale's scale() method will 
 * try to use them as given. What happens, though, is the inbound number gets multiplied against others 
 * AS THEY UNDERSTAND MULTIPLICATION. Scaling a complex by a real will work all right unless one thought the 
 * scaling was between two complex numbers. THAT'S why Scale AND Monad implement Modal, but nothing is enforced yet.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * 2. If someone invents a new ProtoN child, there is a ton of work to do as the builders and other enumerations 
 * have to be adapted. Any class implementing Modal might have methods that switch on CladosField values. 
 * So... be cautious about inventing new CladosF numbers. Lots of work will have to be done.

	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * 1. If the monad is an actual idempotent, return true. This is trivial case.
	 * 2. If not, find first non-zero coefficient of the square of the monad and...
	 * a) re-scale monad by inverse of that coefficient. Use copy to avoid change.

	 * Since the map internal to a Monad's Scale can accept any of the CladosF

	 * This would normally cause warnings by the compiler since the generic named in
	 * the internal map IS a ProtoN child AND casting an unchecked type could
	 * fail at runtime.
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * That won't happen here when CladosF builders are used. They can't build
	 * anything that is NOT a ProtoN child. They can't even build a
	 * ProtoN instance directly. Therefore, only children can arrive as the
	 * value parameter of the 'put' function. Thus, there is no danger of a failed
