/**
 * Nyads are technically lists of monads that share a common foot, but do not necessarily share the same algebra.
 * In use they are the cladosG representation of an 'extensor'. While monads can directly represent geometry, 
 * nyads are maps using monads as operators where more than one monad is required. Monads are also operators by 
 * themselves, so nyads are extensions on the range of transformations represented.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * Examples&lt;br&gt;
 * Nyad arity = 0: Multivector Q	: No operand. It is what it is... but it can be composed with others.&lt;br&gt;
 * Nyad arity = 1: Mirror M 		: Reflection of an operand (Inverse mirror is computed then used.)&lt;br&gt;
 * Nyad arity = 1: Rotor R 			: Rotation of an operand (Inverse rotor is computed then used.)&lt;br&gt;
 * Nyad arity = 2: Mirrors M1, M2 	: Rotation as a double reflection of an operand.&lt;br&gt;
 * Nyad arity = n: Mirrors M1...Mn	: N-fold composition of reflections covers a lot of transformations.&lt;br&gt;
 * Nyad arity = p+q+r	: Single blade monads m1...m_p+q+r : Basis transformations not reached by reflections.&lt;br&gt;
 * Nyad arity = 2(p+q+r): Single blade monds for two distinct p+q+r algebras : Ken Greider's 'Connector' idea which
 * is like a basis transformation but between two distinct algebras.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * If the monads involved are of different algebras, there is no path to simplifying them. The nyad is essentially
 * a juxtapostion of monads that might be related through other objects, but not in the nyad. The juxtapostion
 * flag signals when there are no shared algebras.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
 * If the monad are of the same algebra, this is a path to simplyfying them but it could be through multiplication 
 * or addition which isn't specified in the nyad. If it is through multiplication, then composition is possible. 
 * If it is through  addition, then summation is possible. Since only one flag is needed to signal summation and 
 * composition are possible, the composition flag suffices.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * Unary Operations :&lt;br&gt;
 * 1) Nyad Weight	: Monads that share an algebra are added.&lt;br&gt; TODO
 * 2) Nyad Compose	: Moads that share an algebra are multiplied where left -&gt; right is stack top -&gt; bottom.&lt;br&gt; TODO
 * Binary Operations:&lt;br&gt;
 * 3) Nyad Add		: Monad list of one is appended to the other.&lt;br&gt; TODO
 * 4) Nyad Multiply	: Monads sharing algebras are multiplied. Danglers are added as if multiplied by ONE.&lt;br&gt;
 * Each of these pairs connects to the concepts of addition and multiplication and might easily be recognized by
 * other names. For example, nyad's 'compose' is both multiplication and simplification. A nyad with two mirrors
 * from the same algebra can be used to rotate operands in the algebra, but the two mirrors can be kept separate
 * or simplified to create a rotor without changing what they nyad can do. TODO
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * Compression Operations:&lt;br&gt;
 * 1) Projection	: A monad in one algebra is simply expressed in another algebra re-using weights.&lt;br&gt;
 * Projection involves reassigning equivalent blades in the basis for a monad. Weights are preserved. The simplest
 * projection involves taking a scalar from one algebra and treating it like a scalar from another one. Another 
 * involves taking a k-blade in one algebra as the pscalar in a smaller algebra. It is assumed that a generator 
 * e_i in one algebra means the same thing in the other algebra, so transformations might have to occur before
 * projection in order to make this true.&lt;br&gt; TODO
 * 2) Compression	: A monad in one algebra is projected to another and then composed with another.&lt;br&gt;
 * Compression can be left or right sided or symmetric or antisymmetric versions. Projection then Composition.&lt;br&gt;
 * Examples of this operation can be found in the work of Ken Greider and his students in support of classical
 * and quantum field theories using Clifford algebras. TODO
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * The Nyad is an evolving class. It is meant to encompass extensors as Hestenes described them. Nyad's methods
 * will likely change in the near future as it is adapted to current uses that might not make use of 'extensor' 
 * as a term yet. If the operations become complicated enough, Nyad will be subclassed and specialized at the 
 * child class level instead of being turned into a hairball.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * NOTE: Nyads are Modal because they contain modal objects. Nyad does not directly refer to modal numbers, but 
 * mode protections are required to ensure Nyad does not mix representations of precision or complexity. Monads
 * are modal, so methods handling them must be also.
 * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * ALSO NOTE: While Nyads are modal, they may not be Unitized. Nyads are the maps of things that may be unitized.
