<p>If you don't know what a Clifford Algebra is, you are encouraged to read about them. Geometric Algebras are also Clifford Algebras and provide geometry modeling choice variations, so don't bypass content describing them either. They all offer a tidy mathematical formalism combining many disparate tools of geometry enabling one to wield them in algebraic ways. </p>
<p>The best way get started nowadays is to drop by the <a class="externalLink" href="https://bivector.net/">Bivector.net</a> Discord Server. There is also a lot of You Tube content from recent years ranging from teaching material from <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/@sudgylacmoe/videos">sudgylacmoe</a> to research grade reference from <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/@eigenchris">eigenchris</a>, but many of the creators can be found on the Discord.</p></section><section><a id="Project_History"></a>
<h1>Project History</h1>
<p>The tools contained in this library evolved from work done at UC Davis between the late 1970's and early 1990's. It is intended to support physical models that rely upon geometry in the style taught by Prof. Ken Greider.</p>
<p>The word 'Clados' is an acronym for CLifford Algebra Derived ObjectS. It was chosen to avoid math library name collisions and because it comes close to the concept of 'clade' which this author finds apropos for multivectors.</p>
<p>Basic and complete geometric objects are modeled by the Monad class which most people think of as 'Multivector.' A modeling requirement for aggregates of multivectors drove the main decision to use 'Monad' instead because 'Mult-multivector' is a mouthful. </p>
<p>Nyads are Monad aggregates and are modeled as lists. Lists of increasing size form a series {Monad, Dyad, Triad, Tetrad, ...}, so there is some sense to our naming convention. However, for implementors not interested in aggregates, the name 'Monad' is unfortunate. Please treat it as a synonym for multivector.</p></section><section><a id="Examples"></a>

<h1>API</h1>
<p>The primary use case for Clados is as a low level geometry library, so the API documentation is critical to its purpose. When used properly, a library user should never have to concern themselves with <b>how</b> Clifford algebras are represented. Intead they may focus on <b>how</b> geometry is represented and then folded into physical simulations. </p>
<p>The API docs show which classes are present and how to interact with them, but private elements and methods do most of the low level work where they are intentionally kept out of reach of most library users. One may look at the code directly, but one should never have to worry about how blade multiplication works especially when it comes to bit key handling.</p>
<p><a href="./apidocs/index.html">The v2.0 API</a></p></section><section><a id="Other_References"></a>
<h1>Other References</h1>
<p>There is a project related book that might help, but it is admittedly stale AND doesn't have introductory material. The book focuses upon package contents, what they do and why, and finishes with usage examples largely associated with physics simulations. </p>
<p>Two significant parts are very stale: the API and the Mechanics model. Use the API Docs (Javadocs) in the link above because the material in the book relates to Clados v1.0. The physics models won't survive unchanged when this library reaches v2.0 either and that's almost done. So until the book is updated, treat it as an exploration/research project regarding polycovariance and the broader meaning of 'meaning' in physical models. </p>
<p>Maintain a healthy sense of skepticism... and try things for yourself.</p>

<h1>Communicating</h1>
<p>If you have problems or think you have found an issue in Clados, please report it at the Clados project site at GitHub. If you can take the time to look and see if it is already reported, it would be appreciated. Tell us you found it either way, though, because it helps to know the number of impacted people.</p>
<p>If you want to check up on what is going on, drop by the Bivector Discord server where I hang out, or leave a note at the GitHub project. Honestly, though, the Discord server works better.</p>
<p><b>Thank You(!) for your support!</b></p><hr /></section><section><a id="Usage"></a>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>Clados is a single java module with four packages meant to be used as a math library. Place the clados jar where you normally place 3rd party libraries and adjust your classpath accordingly.</p>
<p>Don't have the jar file? Build it from source. The project has been through several cycles of different build tools, but is currently set up for Maven. I'll release the v2.0 jar soon, but a current build by you will have almost everything in it. </p><hr /></section><section><a id="License"></a>
